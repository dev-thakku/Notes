# Graphs

## Introduction

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

>A Graph consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and set of Edges which connect a pair of nodes.

## Types of graphs

### 1. Directed Graphs: 
A directed graph is graph, in which all the edges are **directed** from one vertex to another.

Example of a directed graph with three vertices and four directed edges (the double arrow represents an edge in each direction).

### 2. Undirected Graphs:
An undirected graph is graph, in which all the edges are **bidirectional**.
